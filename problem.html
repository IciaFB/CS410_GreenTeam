<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>
Travelers, immigrants, and international professionals often face the issue of language barriers and miss out on being able to quickly understand what others are saying. These language barriers lead to confusion, lost time, frustration, and sometimes errors in personal or professional settings.<br><br> 

Current solutions like smartphone translation apps are often slow, inaccurate, and unable to handle regional dialects or cultural nuances. Solutions on the smartphone are lacking due to having to get the phone out and launch the application.
